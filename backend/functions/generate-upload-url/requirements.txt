# Dependencies for generate-upload-url Lambda function
#
# Note: boto3 and botocore are included in the AWS Lambda Python runtime
# and do not need to be packaged with the deployment.
#
# If you need specific versions different from the runtime, uncomment and specify:
# boto3>=1.34.0
# botocore>=1.34.0
#
# This function has no external dependencies beyond the Lambda runtime.
