# Dependencies for process-upload Lambda function
#
# IMPORTANT: This function uses the AWS Lambda Layer for data processing.
# Layer: arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:336392948345:layer:AWSSDKPandas-Python312:14
#
# The following packages are provided by the Lambda Layer and do NOT need
# to be included in the deployment package:
#
# - awswrangler (AWS Data Wrangler for S3/Parquet operations)
# - pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)
# - numpy (Numerical computing, pandas dependency)
# - pyarrow (Parquet file support)
# - boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)
# - botocore (Low-level AWS service access)
#
# If you need to add additional dependencies beyond the layer, list them below.
# Keep the deployment package small to reduce cold start times.
#
# Example:
# requests>=2.31.0
# python-dateutil>=2.8.2

# Schema validation
jsonschema>=4.20.0
